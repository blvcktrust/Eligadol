# Eligadol
For the beautiful angel Eli, As I sit down to pen these words, I find myself enchanted by the radiance of your presence, both in my thoughts and in the world around me. Your beauty, both inside and out, captivates me in ways I struggle to articulate.

In your eyes, I see a reflection of warmth and kindness that ignites a flame of admiration within me. Your smile, like the sun breaking through the clouds on a rainy day, brings joy and brightens even the darkest of moments.

But beyond your undeniable physical allure both at the front and back, it is your freespirit that truly mesmerizes me. Your intelligence, grace, and compassion illuminate every conversation we share, leaving me in awe of the depth of your character.

In our talks, I feel a sense of tranquility and comfort, as if the world fades away and only you remain. Your laughter is like music to my ears, and your words are poetry to my eye.

I am grateful for every moment we spend talking together, for each smile you grace me with, and for the privilege of knowing someone as extraordinary as you. You are a beacon of light, and I am endlessly thankful for your presence.

With all my admiration and affection,

Trust Temilayo
